                    Because water is so important, you might wonder if you're drinking enough.
                    There is no magic amount of water that you need to drink every day.
                    The amount you need depends on their age, body size, health, and activity level,
                    plus the weather (temperature and humidity levels).
                    Usually, people drink something with meals, and when thirsty.
                    However, when sick, or if it's warm out, or if you're exercising, you'll need more.
                    Be sure to drink some extra water when you're out in warm weather, especially while playing sports or exercising!
